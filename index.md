### CPSC 120

* Lab 1
    Lab 1 was enjoyable because it helped me to become very familiar with 
    github and the commands involved like pushing and commiting code. I was
    also able to become more familiar C++ with this lab.

* Lab 4
    I enjoyed lab 4 part 2 because I thought that the hi-low game would be
    intersting to program. It also helped me to become more familiar with
    if, else if and else statements.

* Lab 7
    Lab 7, part 2 was probably my favorite lab, because the game seemed more
    complex than many of the other labs we had done. I enjoyed figuring out
    how and when to use the || and && statements for different outcomes of
    the game
